=== OVERVIEW ===

Ultra-faint Galaxy Likelihood (UGaLi) is a set of python 
classes and functions used to search for ultra-faint satellite 
galaxies of the Milky Way using the stellar object samples 
derived from optical photometric surveys.

Mangle:
Not a strict dependency. Used to interface with masks produced by
the Dark Energy Survey Data Mangement group. Download and documentation 
available at http://space.mit.edu/~molly/mangle/

Isochrones:
Currently set up to use isochrones in the format produced by Leo Girardi's (Padova)
CMD tool, which has a web interface at http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd

=== ABBREVIATIONS ===

IMF: initial mass function
CMD: color-magnitude diagram
ROI: region of interest
PDF: probability distribution function

=== TO DO ===

* Change name of ugali.utils.projector to ugali.utils.coords
* Consistent naming convention for pix vs. pixel
* Simulator tool to place satellites randomly in the survey
* Farm should write out config file for future reference
* Consistently make use of angToPix and pixToAng
* Be careful with spatialBin function when objects fall outside of ROI (CHECK!)
* Residual maps / how to deal with gradients in background (important mainly for LMC region)
* Compute observable fraction including photometric errors
* Check for numerical issues with very small Plummer radii
* Alternative IMFs
* Collector function to find peaks (in 3D)
* Save stellar mass instead of richness?
* Compute the visual magnitude, or luminosity
